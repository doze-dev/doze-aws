// Making sure .doze resolves before anything depends on it.
//
// # The three paths, and why they are different
//
// Setting up the zone is privileged: it writes /etc/resolver/doze on macOS, or
// a systemd unit and an /etc/hosts block on Linux. So "just do it" is not
// available, and the right move depends on who is asking.
//
//	already root   install directly. This is the ordinary CONTAINER case — a
//	               process running as root inside its own filesystem, where
//	               writing /etc/hosts is unremarkable and there is nobody to
//	               ask. No prompt, no TTY needed.
//
//	a TTY          offer it, and run one sudo. A developer at a terminal can
//	               answer, and names.Install does the whole thing under a
//	               single prompt.
//
//	neither        print the command and exit. This is CI, a systemd unit, a
//	               background `doze-aws &`.
//
// # Why the last one exits rather than prompting
//
// sudo with no TTY waits for a password that will never arrive. A server that
// HANGS at boot is worse than one that errors: CI sits there until the job
// times out, with no output explaining why. And passwordless sudo is the other
// trap — it would succeed silently, rewriting a build machine's DNS as a side
// effect of starting a test fixture.
//
// An unexpected password prompt from a long-running server is also the shape
// users are rightly trained to distrust. From `doze-aws init` it is
// unremarkable; from "start the server" it is not.
